Installed Xilinx "vivado" SDK on work desktop.

Do get their installer to work, I had to:

1) export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1
2) install wmname
3) wmname LG3D

Then it worked.

There is a log in /root/.Xilinix/xinstall/xinstall_1428981208402.log... hopefully that can be used to unwind changes if this craps all over my hard drive.

To actually use xilinx tools, we need to source /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2014.4/settings64.sh
