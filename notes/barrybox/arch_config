5 May 2015:
Ran into stability issues after recent upgrade.  Seems to be related to microcode for Haswell processors.  Manifested as segfault on vim exit.

Per suggestion on arch forum for same symptom, attempting to upgrade microcode by:

1) Installing package intel-ucode
2) Adding this line to /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf (am using gummiboot on this system), right BEFORE (it has to be first) the existing ramdisk line.
initrd /intel-ucode.img
